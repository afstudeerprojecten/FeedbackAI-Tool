## Configuration

We're using environment variables to configure stuff. You're expected to create a `.env` file in the root of the project and set this variable

```bash
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

### Developer notice

>PLEASE READ!

By default, environment variables that are undefined should default to `CONFIG_<VARIABLE_NAME>`. This is important for deploying using Docker. You can use this snippet as a reference:

```ts
const API_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_BACKEND_URL ?? "CONFIG_BACKEND_URL";  
             // This is to get the env var       if null, return CONFIG_BACKEND_URL
```
